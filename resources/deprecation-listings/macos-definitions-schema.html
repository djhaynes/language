      <div class="deprecation_info"><strong>Deprecated As Of Version: </strong>5.10<br><strong>Reason: </strong>The inetlisteningservers_test has been deprecated and replaced by the inetlisteningserver510_test. The name of an application
         cannot be used to uniquely identify an application that is listening on the network. As a result, the inetlisteningserver510_object
         utilizes the protocol, local_address, and local_port entities to uniquely identify an application listening on the network.
         Please see the inetlisteningserver510_test for additional information.<br></div>
      <p class="documentation">This test's purpose is generally used to check if an application is listening on the network, either for a new connection
         or as part of an ongoing connection. This is limited to applications that are listening for connections that use the TCP or
         UDP protocols and have addresses represented as IPv4 or IPv6 addresses (AF_INET or AF_INET6). It is generally speaking the
         parsed output of running the command netstat -tuwlnpe with root privilege.
