      <p class="documentation">The EntityStateSharedResourceTypeType complex type defines the different values that are valid for the type entity of a shared
         resource state. Note that the Windows API returns a DWORD value and OVAL uses the constant name that is normally defined for
         these return values. This is done to increase readability and maintainability of OVAL Definitions. The empty string is also
         allowed as a valid value to support an empty element that is found when a variable reference is used within the type entity.
         Note that when using pattern matches and variables care must be taken to ensure that the regular expression and variable values
         align with the enumerated values.
      </p>
      <p class="documentation">It is also important to note that special shared resources are those reserved for remote administration, interprocess communication,
         and administrative shares.
