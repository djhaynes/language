      <p class="documentation">The patch test reveals the installation status of a specific patch in the VMware ESX server. This information can be retrieved
         by the "esxupdate query | grep ESX-xxxxxxx" command. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema
         and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. The required object element references a patch_object
         and the optional state element specifies the metadata to check.

      <div class="deprecation_info"><strong>Deprecated As Of Version: </strong>5.6<br><strong>Reason: </strong>Replaced by the patch56_object. The deprecated patch_test has a bug where the patch name entity is defined as a string in
         the object yet is defined as an int in the state.  Additional state entities have also been added to the new patch56_test.<br><strong>Comment: </strong>This object has been deprecated and will be removed in version 6.0 of the language.<br></div>
      <p class="documentation">The patch_object element is used by a patch test to define those objects to be evaluated based on a specified state. Each
         object extends the standard ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description
         for more information. The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic. Again, please
         refer to the description of the set element in the oval-definitions-schema.
      </p>
      <p class="documentation">A patch_object consists of a single patch_number entity that identifies the patch to be checked.</p><br><hr class="thick">

      <div class="deprecation_info"><strong>Deprecated As Of Version: </strong>5.6<br><strong>Reason: </strong>Replaced by the patch56_state. The deprecated patch_test has a bug where the patch name entity is defined as a string in the

      <p class="documentation">The patch_state element defines the information about a specific patch. The patch_number element identifies this patch, and
         the status element reveals the installation status of this patch in the VMware ESX server. For instance, after the "esxupdate
         query | grep ESX-2559638" command is run, the result is either a string similar to "ESX-2559638 15:27:17 04/05/07 Update info
         rpm for ESX 3.0.1." or empty.

      <div class="deprecation_info"><strong>Deprecated As Of Version: </strong>5.6<br><strong>Reason: </strong>Replaced by Patch56Behaviors. The deprecated patch_test has a bug where the patch name entity is defined as a string in the
         object yet is defined as an int in the state.  Additional state entities have also been added to the new patch56_test.<br><strong>Comment: </strong>These behaviors have been deprecated and will be removed in version 6.0 of the language.<br></div>
      <p class="documentation">The PatchBehaviors complex type defines a number of behaviors that allow a more detailed definition of the patch_object being
         specified. Note that using these behaviors may result in some unique results. For example, a double negative type condition
         might be created where an object entity says include everything except a specific item, but a behavior is used that might
         then add that item back in.
