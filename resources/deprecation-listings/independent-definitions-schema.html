         in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. The required object

      <p class="documentation">The filehash_object element is used by a file hash test to define the specific file(s) to be evaluated. The filehash_object
         will only collect regular files on UNIX systems and FILE_TYPE_DISK files on Windows systems. Each object extends the standard
         ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description for more information.
         The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic. Again, please refer to the description
         of the set element in the oval-definitions-schema.
      </p>
      <p class="documentation">A filehash_object defines the path and filename of the file(s). In addition, a number of behaviors may be provided that help
         guide the collection of objects. Please refer to the FileBehaviors complex type for more information about specific behaviors.
      </p>
      <p class="documentation">The set of files to be evaluated may be identified with either a complete filepath or a path and filename. Only one of these
         options may be selected.
      </p>
      <p class="documentation">It is important to note that the 'max_depth' and 'recurse_direction' attributes of the 'behaviors' element do not apply to
         the 'filepath' element, only to the 'path' and 'filename' elements.  This is because the 'filepath' element represents an
         absolute path to a particular file and it is not possible to recurse over a file.
