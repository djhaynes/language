      <div class="deprecation_info"><strong>Deprecated As Of Version: </strong>5.10<br><strong>Reason: </strong>Replaced by the rpmverifyfile_test and the rpmverifypackage_test. The rpmverify_test was split into two tests to distinguish
         between the verification of the files in an rpm and the verification of an rpm as a whole. By making this distinction, content
         authoring is simplified and information is no longer duplicated across items. See the rpmverifyfile_test and rpmverifypackage_test.<br><strong>Comment: </strong>This test has been deprecated and will be removed in version 6.0 of the language.<br></div>
      <p class="documentation">The rpmverify_test is used to verify the integrity of installed RPMs. This test aligns with the rpm -V command for verifying
         RPMs. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description
         for more information. The required object element references a rpmverify_object and the optional state element specifies the
         data to check.

      <div class="deprecation_info"><strong>Deprecated As Of Version: </strong>5.10<br><strong>Reason: </strong>Replaced by the rpmverifyfile_object and rpmverifypackage_object. The rpmverify_test was split into two tests to distinguish

      <p class="documentation">The rpmverify_object element is used by a rpmverity_test to define a set of files within a set of RPMs to verify. Each object
         extends the standard ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description
         for more information. The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic. Again, please
         refer to the description of the set element in the oval-definitions-schema.

      <div class="deprecation_info"><strong>Deprecated As Of Version: </strong>5.10<br><strong>Reason: </strong>Replaced by the rpmverifyfile_state and rpmverifypackage_state. The rpmverify_test was split into two tests to distinguish

      <p class="documentation">The rpmverify_state element defines the different information that can be used to evaluate the specified rpm. This includes
         the architecture, epoch number, and version numbers. Most of this information can be obtained through the rpm function. Please
         refer to the individual elements in the schema for more details about what each represents.

      <h3><a name="RpmVerifyBehaviors"></a><a href="../documentation/linux-definitions-schema.html#RpmVerifyBehaviors">== RpmVerifyBehaviors ==</a></h3>
      <div class="deprecation_info"><strong>Deprecated As Of Version: </strong>5.10<br><strong>Reason: </strong>Replaced by the RpmVerifyFileBehaviors and the RpmVerifyPackageBehaviors. The RpmVerifyBehaviors complex type is used by the
         rpmverify_test which was split into two tests to distinguish between the verification of the files in an rpm and the verification
         of an rpm as a whole. By making this distinction, content authoring is simplified and information is no longer duplicated
         across items. The new tests utilize the RpmVerifyFileBehaviors and RpmVerifyPackageBehaviors complex types, and as a result,
         the RpmVerifyBehaviors complex type is no longer needed.<br><strong>Comment: </strong>This complex type has been deprecated and will be removed in version 6.0 of the language.<br></div>
      <p class="documentation">The RpmVerifyBehaviors complex type defines a set of behaviors that for controlling how installed rpms are verified. These
         behaviors align with the verify-options of the rpm command with the addition of two behaviors that will indicate that a file
         with a given attribute marker should not be collected.
