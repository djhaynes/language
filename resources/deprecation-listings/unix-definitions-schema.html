      <h3><a name="FileBehaviors"></a><a href="../documentation/unix-definitions-schema.html#FileBehaviors">== FileBehaviors ==</a></h3>
      <p class="documentation">The FileBehaviors complex type defines a number of behaviors that allow a more detailed definition of the file_object being
         specified.  Note that using these behaviors may result in some unique results.  For example, a double negative type condition
         might be created where an object entity says include everything except a specific item, but a behavior is used that might
         then add that item back in.
      </p>
      <p class="documentation">It is important to note that the 'max_depth' and 'recurse_direction' attributes of the 'behaviors' element do not apply to
         the 'filepath' element, only to the 'path' and 'filename' elements.  This is because the 'filepath' element represents an
         absolute path to a particular file and it is not possible to recurse over a file.

      <h3><a name="process_test"></a><a href="../documentation/unix-definitions-schema.html#process_test">&lt; process_test  &gt;</a></h3>
      <div class="deprecation_info"><strong>Deprecated As Of Version: </strong>5.8<br><strong>Reason: </strong>The process_test has been deprecated and replaced by the process58_test. The command line of a process cannot be used to uniquely
         identify a process. As a result, the pid entity was added to the process58_object. Please see the process58_test for additional
         information.<br></div>
      <p class="documentation">The process test is used to check information found in the UNIX processes. It is equivalent to parsing the output of the ps
         command. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description
         for more information. The required object element references a process_object and the optional state element specifies the
         process information to check.
      </p><br><hr class="thick">
      <h3><a name="process_object"></a><a href="../documentation/unix-definitions-schema.html#process_object">&lt; process_object  &gt;</a></h3>
      <div class="deprecation_info"><strong>Deprecated As Of Version: </strong>5.8<br><strong>Reason: </strong>The process_object has been deprecated and replaced by the process58_object. The command line of a process cannot be used
         to uniquely identify a process. As a result, the pid entity was added to the process58_object. Please see the process58_object
         for additional information.<br></div>
      <p class="documentation">The process_object element is used by a process test to define the specific process(es) to be evaluated. Each object extends
         the standard ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description for more
         information. The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic. Again, please refer
         to the description of the set element in the oval-definitions-schema.
      </p>
      <p class="documentation">A process object defines the command line used to start the process(es).</p><br><hr class="thick">
      <h3><a name="process_state"></a><a href="../documentation/unix-definitions-schema.html#process_state">&lt; process_state  &gt;</a></h3>
      <div class="deprecation_info"><strong>Deprecated As Of Version: </strong>5.8<br><strong>Reason: </strong>The process_state has been deprecated and replaced by the process58_state. The command line of a process cannot be used to
         uniquely identify a process. As a result, the pid entity was added to the process58_object. Please see the process58_state
         for additional information.<br></div>
      <p class="documentation">The process_state element defines the different metadata associated with a UNIX process. This includes the command line, pid,
         ppid, priority, and user id. Please refer to the individual elements in the schema for more details about what each represents.
